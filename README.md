# FizzBuzz

implemented in the C programming Language (C99)

simply having some fun and reviewing conditional compilation with make and the C pre-processor

# Compilation

`make` to simply compile

`make NUMBER=1` to enable printing the numbers before fuzz, buzz, fizzbuzz, or the number

`make SLEEP=1` to enable a small delay before each print

`make DEBUG` to enable the `-g` compile flag to add debug symbols

and they can be combined to add numbers and delay, numbers and debug symbols, etc.
